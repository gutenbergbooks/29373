<p>Do you believe that girls should like to work at home, to cook
and clean house and mind the baby? Do you believe that a girl
should like to take care of her clothes and be able to make them;
that she should know how to be thrifty and to conserve the family
money in buying and using food and clothing; that she should play
a fair game and put the group above her personal interests? Do
you believe that she should value a strong healthy body above clothes
and cosmetics, and rejoice in the hope of being some day the healthy
mother of healthy children?</p>

<p>If you do, you believe in the Girl Scouts, for in this organization
the girls learn all these things in such a happy way that they <i>like</i>
to do them, which means that they keep on doing them.</p>

<p>The Girl Scouts, a national organization, is open to any girl who
expresses her desire to join, and voluntarily accepts the promise and
the laws. The object of the Girl Scouts is to bring to all girls the
opportunity for group experience, outdoor life, and to learn through
work, but more by play, to serve their community. Patterned after
the Girl Guides of England, the sister organization of the Boy
Scouts, the Girl Scouts have developed a method of self-government
and a variety of activities that appear to be well suited to the desires
of the girls, as the 89,864 scouts and the 2,500 new applicants
each month testify.</p>


<h3><a name="HISTORY_AND_GROWTH" id="HISTORY_AND_GROWTH"></a>HISTORY AND GROWTH.</h3>


<p>Girl Scouts and their leaders, to the number of 89,864, were in
1920 organized in every State, and in Hawaii, Porto Rico, and Alaska.
There are troops in 1,400 cities, and local councils in 162 places. This
represents a tremendous growth since the founding by Mrs. Juliette
Low in March, 1912, of a handful of enthusiastic &ldquo;Girl Guides&rdquo; in
Savannah, Ga. In 1915 the growth of the movement warranted its
national incorporation; so headquarters were established in Washington,
D. C., and the name changed to Girl Scouts, Incorporated. In
1916 the headquarters were removed to New York, and are now
located at 189 Lexington Avenue.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>From the start the organization has been nonsectarian and open to
all races and nationalities. Through the International Council the
Girl Scouts are affiliated with the Girl Guides of England and all
parts of the British Empire, and similar organizations in other parts
of the world.</p>

<p>At the 1920 meeting of the international conference at London,
reports were received from Italy, France, Belgium, Switzerland,
Poland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Portugal, Russia,
Czechoslovakia, Brazil, Argentina, Japan, China, and Siberia,
as well as from all parts of the British Empire, and the United
States.</p>

<p>From a membership of 9,769 in January, 1918, the girl scouts grew
to 89,864 in 1921, at the rate of nearly 10 to 1 in three years. The
greatest relative growth was in 1918, when the membership grew
fourfold. During 1919 the increase over the preceding year was
more than two-thirds, while in 1920 the relative increase was one-third.
The details are as shown in the accompanying table.</p>

<p>This growth is due to a spontaneous demand of community after
community for scouting for girls, and not to deliberate propaganda
on the part of the national headquarters. The reasons for it are
therefore to be sought in the activities and methods themselves,
which make such widespread appeal.</p>


<h3><a name="ACTIVITIES" id="ACTIVITIES"></a>ACTIVITIES.</h3>


<p>A glance through the handbook, Scouting for Girls, will show that
the activities of the girl scouts center about the three interests&mdash;Home,
Health, and Citizenship.</p>

<p><i>Home.</i>&mdash;The program provides incentives for practicing woman's
world-old arts by requiring an elementary proficiency in cooking,
housekeeping, first aid, and the rules of healthful living for any
girl scout passing beyond the Tenderfoot stage. Of the forty-odd
subjects for which Proficiency Badges are given, more than one-fourth
are in subjects directly related to the services of woman in the
home, as mother, nurse, or home-keeper.</p>

<p>Into this work, so often distasteful because solitary, is brought
the sense of comradeship. This is effected partly by having much of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the actual training done in groups. Another element is the public
recognition and rewarding of skill in this, woman's most elementary
service to the world, usually taken for granted and ignored.</p>

<p>The spirit of play infused into the simplest and most repetitious
of household tasks banishes drudgery. &ldquo;Give us, oh, give us,&rdquo; says
Carlyle, &ldquo;the man who sings at his work. He will do more in the
same time, he will do it better, he will persevere longer. Wondrous
is the strength of cheerfulness; altogether past comprehension its
power of endurance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While the place of most production is to-day outside the home,
much of the final preparation of goods, particularly food and clothing,
is still done there. So that, while the homecrafts are far from
being the vital necessities they once were, they are still needed.</p>

<p>Handicrafts of many sorts enter into the program of the girl
scouts. In camping, girls must know how to set up tents, build
lean-to's, and construct fireplaces. They must also know how to
make knots of various sorts to use for bandages, tying parcels, hitching,
etc. Among the productive occupations in which Proficiency
Badges are awarded are cooking, house planning, beekeeping, dairying
and general farming, gardening, millinery, weaving, and needlework.</p>

<p>While production has left the home, consumption is increasingly
the business of the home-keeping woman. There are few purchases,
even for men's own use, which women do not have a hand in selecting.
Practically the entire burden of household buying in all departments
falls on the woman, who is thus in a position to learn how to
spend wisely and make the most of each dollar. In France this has
long been recognized, and the women of the middle classes are the
buying partners and bookkeepers in their husbands' business.</p>

<p>The girl-scout organization encourages thrifty habits and economy
in buying in all of its activities. The scout troops are self-supporting,
and are expected to earn most of their equipment by means of
rallies, pageants, plays, as well as by individual effort. One of the
10 scout laws is that &ldquo;A girl scout is thrifty.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Health.</i>&mdash;The girl scout learns that &ldquo;a cheerful scout, a clean scout,
a helpful scout is a well scout. She is the only scout that really <i>is
prepared</i>.&rdquo; So that health, physical and mental, is the keynote to the
scout activities, which are calculated to develop the habit of health,
rather than simply to give information about anatomy or physiology.
Personal health is recognized by the badge of &ldquo;Health Winner,&rdquo;
given to the girl who for three months follows certain rules of living,
such as eating only wholesome food, drinking plenty of water,
going to bed early, exercising in the open air, and keeping clean,
and who shows the result by improved posture, and by the absence of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
constipation and colds. Outdoor sports, swimming, boating, and
dancing are other health-producing activities.</p>

<p>Of all health-promoting activities, camping is the best, and this
means all stages of life in the open, from the day's hike, with one
meal out of doors, to the overnight or week-end hike, and finally the
real, big camp, open all summer. Girl scouts learn how to dress for
outdoor living, how to walk without fatigue, and how to provide
themselves with food, warmth, and shelter, so that &ldquo;roughing it&rdquo;
does not mean being uncomfortable.</p>

<p>During 1920, 50 large girl-scout camps were maintained in 16
States. These are self-supporting, and as they are open for 10 weeks
as a rule and accommodate about 50 girls at a time, they give an
opportunity to several thousand for the best sort of holiday.</p>

<p>The idea is to have enough camps to give every scout the experience.
To promote this work national headquarters maintains a camping
section and has published a book, &ldquo;Campward Ho!&rdquo; which gives
full directions for organizing and running large, self-supporting
camps for girls.</p>

<p>Community health habits are quite as important as the purely personal,
and the older girl scout is expected to become a &ldquo;health
guardian,&rdquo; which means that she takes an intelligent interest in the
things pertaining to public health, such as playgrounds, swimming
pools, school lunches, the water and milk supplies, clean streets, the
disposition of waste and garbage, the registration of births, and the
prevention of infant mortality. She also learns how to help in times
of emergency as first aid, in sickness as home nurse, and at any time
as child nurse.</p>

<p>A scout whose mind is filled with interesting facts about birds and
animals and trees, and who is busy playing games with her companions
or in making useful and beautiful things and in rendering
active service to her home and community, is apt to have a
healthy mind without thinking much about it. And she has a little
rule for the blue times, which is &ldquo;to smile and sing under all difficulties.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Citizenship.</i>&mdash;The basic organization of the girl scouts into the self-governing
unit of a patrol is in itself an excellent means of political
training. Patrols and troops conduct their own meetings, and the
scouts learn the elements of parliamentary law. Working together
in groups, they realize the necessity for democratic decisions. They
also come to have community interests of an impersonal sort. This
is perhaps the greatest single contribution of the scouts toward the
training of girls for citizenship. Little boys play not only together
but with men and boys of all ages. The interest of baseball is not
confined to any one age. The rules of the game are the same for
all, and the smallest boy's judgment on the skill of the players may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
be as valid as that of the oldest &ldquo;fan.&rdquo; Girls have had in the past no
such common interests. Their games have been either solitary or in
very small groups, in activities largely of a personal character. If
women are to be effective in modern political society, they must have
from earliest youth gregarious interests and occupations.</p>

<p>Among the scout activities that tend to develop this larger community
sense are games, athletic sports of all kinds, including team
work and competition between small, well-knit groups. Folk dancing
and other forms of amusement, such as dramatics, pageants, and
story-telling, serve a similar purpose because they all mean the possession
of a resource not only for the right use of the girl's own leisure
time, but for serving this need in the community.</p>


<h3><a name="METHODS" id="METHODS"></a>METHODS.</h3>


<p>The activities of the girl scouts are, of course, not peculiar to this
organization. Every one of them is provided for elsewhere, in
schools, clubs, and societies. But the way in which they are combined
and coordinated about certain basic principles is peculiar to
the girl scouts.</p>

<p>In the first place all these activities have a common motive, which
is preparation for a fuller life for the individual, not only in her
personal but in her social relations. It is believed that both the habits
formed and the concrete information acquired contribute to the girls
being ready to meet intelligently most of the situations that are likely
to arise in their later life. This concept is expressed in the girl
scout's motto, &ldquo;Be prepared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The method of preparation followed is that found in nature,
whereby young animals and birds <i>play</i> at doing all the things they
will need to do well when they are grown and must feed and fend
for themselves and their babies.</p>

<p>The heart of the girl scouts' laws is helpfulness, and so the scouts
have a slogan: &ldquo;Do a good turn daily.&rdquo; By following this in letter
and spirit, helpfulness becomes second nature.</p>

<p>Because the girl scouts are citizens they know and respect the meaning
of the flag, and one of the first things they learn is the pledge:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pledge allegiance to my flag, and to the Republic for which it
stands; one Nation indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some observers have criticized the girl-scout organization because
of its apparently military character. It is true that the girls
wear a uniform of khaki and are grouped in patrols corresponding
to the &ldquo;fours&rdquo; in the Army; that they salute and learn simple
forms of drill and signaling. But the reason they do these is because
the military organization happens to be the oldest form of organization
in the world, and it works. It is the best way men have found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of getting a number of persons to work together. Following directions
given to a group is quite a different matter from doing something
alone, and most of us need special training in this. A group
of eight has been found to work the best, because it is the largest
number that can be handled by a person just beginning to be a leader,
and, moreover, elementary qualities of leadership seem to exist in
just about the proportion of one in eight. It is probably on this
account that children take so kindly to the form, rather than because
of any glamor of the army, though this must be admitted as a
factor. In actual practice the drill and signaling take up a very
small portion of the program and are nowhere followed as ends in
themselves, but only as a means to an end.</p>

<p><i>Uniform.</i>&mdash;The uniform is simple, durable, and allows freedom of
action. It is of khaki because this has been found to be the best
wearing fabric and color. It is not easily torn and does not readily
soil. Wearing it gives the girls a sense of belonging to a larger
group, such as it is hard to get in any other way. It keeps constantly
before them the fact that they represent a community to whose laws
they have voluntarily subscribed, and whose honor they uphold.
It is well, too, to have an impersonal costume, if for no other reason
than to counteract the tendency of girls to concentrate upon their
personal appearance. To have a neat, simple, useful garb is a novel
experience to many an overdressed doll who has been taught to
measure all worth by extravagance of appearance.</p>


<h3><a name="ORGANIZATION" id="ORGANIZATION"></a>ORGANIZATION.</h3>


<p>The outstanding feature of the girl-scout organization is its voluntary
character. Among some 7,400 officers and leaders of girl scouts
throughout the country in the fall of 1920, just 211 were &ldquo;paid
workers.&rdquo; This is about 3 per cent. The organization is actually a
great volunteer school of citizenship in which the women of the country
share with their younger sisters the results of their own experience
in ideals and practical working knowledge of community living.
Scout troops are organized either independently or in connection with
public and private schools, churches, settlements, and other associations.</p>

<p><i>Scouts of different ages.</i>&mdash;The original girl-scout program was
designed mainly with the needs of the young adolescent in mind, and
the age was fixed from 10 to 18 years. But the little girls wanted to
come in, and so a separate division was made for them called the
Brownies or Junior Scouts. Then the older girls and women wanted
to join, and as time went on the original girl scouts grew up but not
out of the scout movement, and programs are being made for Citizen
Scouts who are 18 and over.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>The three age groups seem to be natural ones, and each has its own
methods and activities. The Brownies are formed into packs, under
the leadership of a &ldquo;Brown Owl,&rdquo; and play games and learn self-help
and how to &ldquo;lend a hand&rdquo; to their families. The Citizen Scouts
are expected to be self-directing and to take actual part in the life
of the community and, either as wage earners or service givers, to pay
their way.</p>

<p>But the large majority of all girl scouts belong to the middle group.
More girls register at 13 than at any other age. This is interesting, as
it marks the age of susceptibility to social ideas, shown also by the fact
that it is the most common age of religious conversion. It is also
the age of first crime. The distribution of ages at first registration
is shown by the accompanying table.</p>

<p>The organization of the regular girl scouts is as follows:</p>

<p><i>Patrol.</i>&mdash;Eight girls form a Patrol, which is the working unit.
One of them is elected patrol leader and has charge of the activities
for as long as the patrol wishes. It is desirable to have each
girl of a patrol serve as a leader at some time or other.</p>

<p><i>Troop.</i>&mdash;One or more patrols constitute a Troop, which is the
administrative unit recognized by the national organization. The
Troop meets weekly and wherever possible at a place which &ldquo;belongs&rdquo;
to it. When possible troops should meet outdoors. The
troops are self-supporting and earn money for all equipment as well
as for camps and hikes or special activities. Troops are registered
with national headquarters and pay annual dues of 50 cents for each
member. They also have their own local dues, generally 5 or 10 cents
weekly.</p>

<p><i>Captain.</i>&mdash;The troop is under the direction of a Captain, who must
be at least 21 years of age and whose qualification as a leader of
young girls is passed upon by national headquarters before she is
commissioned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lieutenant.</i>&mdash;A captain may have one or more Lieutenants, who
must be at least 18 years of age, and whose commissions are likewise
subject to control by national headquarters. Captains and lieutenants
may be organized into associations in any given locality.</p>

<p><i>Scout classes.</i>&mdash;There are three classes of girl scouts, the youngest
being the &ldquo;Tenderfoot,&rdquo; the name given by frontiersmen to the man
from the city who is not hardened to the rough life out of doors.
Even the Tenderfoot, however, has to know some things, including
the promise, laws, slogan, and motto; how to salute and the respect
due to the flag; how to make an American flag; and how to tie at
least four kinds of useful knots. She must also have earned enough
money to buy some part of her scout equipment.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Second-class&rdquo; scout has been a tenderfoot for at least one
month and can pass a test of distinctly greater difficulty. This includes,
under home interests, the ability to make fires in stoves and
out of doors, to cook a simple dish so that it will be palatable, to
set a table for two courses, to make an ordinary and a hospital bed,
and to sew.</p>

<p>Under health interests, she must know the main rules of healthful
living, her own height and weight, and their relation to the standard;
some simple first-aid points such as stopping bleeding, removing
speck from eye, and bandaging a sprained ankle. She must
also have a variety of facts at her command that will keep her alert
and interested when out of doors, such as an acquaintance with animals,
birds, and plants, the use of a compass, the alphabet of a signal
code; and must demonstrate her ability to observe her surroundings
accurately and quickly so as to report upon them.</p>

<p>Under topics preparing for citizenship she must know the history
of the American flag, how to prevent fire, and what to do in case of
fire, and must have served her troop, church, or community in some
way and earned or saved money for some personal or troop equipment.</p>

<p>The highest rank is that of &ldquo;First-class&rdquo; scout, and is to be attained
only by a young person of considerable accomplishment. She
must be able to find her way about city or country without any of
the usual aids, using only the compass and her developed judgment
of distance and direction. She must also be able to communicate
and receive messages by signaling. She must have shown proficiency
in home nursing, first aid, and housekeeping, and, in addition,
in either child care, personal health, laundering, cooking, needlework,
or gardening. She must also be an all-round outdoors person,
familiar with camping and able to lead in this, or be a good skater
or a naturalist or be able to swim. Not only must she know all these
different things, but she must have trained a tenderfoot, started a
savings account, and served her community in some tangible way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Proficiency badges.</i>&mdash;After a girl scout has attained to first class
there are still other worlds to conquer, as the badges she has earned
on the way are only a few of the many to be worked toward. There
are no less than 47 subjects in which a scout may achieve, and more
are being added. Just to mention a few: A girl scout may be an
artist, a beekeeper, a business woman, a craftsman, or a dancer; an
electrician, a farmer, a flower finder, a horsewoman, an interpreter,
a motorist; or a musician, a scribe, a swimmer, or a star gazer. The
highest award given is the Golden Eaglet, which means the earning
of 21 Merit Badges, of which 15 are in required subjects.</p>

<p>About 2,000 Merit Badges are earned a month. An analysis of the
subjects shows that home nursing is the most popular, with 126 of
each 1,000 earned. Laundress comes next with 97. First aid is next
with 67. Needlewoman, child nurse, cook, pathfinder, health guardian,
flower finder or zoologist, and home maker complete the first
10 most popular badges, with between 61 and 38 in each 1,000. The
details are shown in the accompanying table.</p>

<p><i>Local councils.</i>&mdash;Where troops are numerous it is usual to form a
council composed of women and men representing all the best interests
of the community: Parents, schools, religious denominations of
all sorts, business, producers, women's clubs, and other social and
philanthropic organizations. The council acts as the link between
the girl scouts and the community. It has the same relation to the
separate troops that the school board has to the schools&mdash;that is,
it guides and decides upon policies and standards, interprets the
scouts to the community and the community to the scouts. It does
not do the executive or teaching work; that belongs to the directors,
captains, lieutenants, and patrol leaders.</p>

<p>One function of the council is to interest public-spirited women
and men, particularly artists and scientists, in girl-scout work and to
get them to act as referees in awarding proficiency badges.</p>

<p>But wisdom is to be sought not only in large cities, where there are
schools and museums, laboratories and studios. It is a poor community
that does not have at least one wise old person&mdash;a farmer
learned in nature's ways, a retired sailor stocked with sea lore, or a
mother of men who knows life as perhaps no one else can. The wise
council will know where to find these natural teachers and see that
the scouts go to their schools.</p>

<p>Another prime function of the council is to raise funds and to
make available such material equipment as camp sites, meeting places
for the troops, etc. The captain should turn to the council for help
in arranging and directing rallies, dances, fairs, pageants, and other
devices for entertainment or securing money.</p>

<p><i>National organization.</i>&mdash;The central governing body of the girl
scouts is the national council, holding an annual convention of elected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
delegates from all local groups. The national council works through
an executive board, which meets monthly and conducts national
headquarters in New York. The national director is in charge of
headquarters and his direct responsibility for the administration of
the whole organization, with the general divisions of field, business,
publication, and education, each in charge of a secretary.</p>

<p>The field work is administered through 14 regions, each covering
several States, and in charge of a regional director, who helps in the
formation of local councils, the training of captains, and acts as
general supervisor and consultant for all work in the district.</p>

<p>Under business comes the handling of mails, all the work of the
shop where uniforms, insignia, books, badges, flags, and other equipment
are sold, and the distribution of material ordered by mail.</p>

<p>There are three classes of publications: First, a monthly journal,
The American Girl. Second, pamphlets and articles for general
propaganda and publicity; these are handled by the editorial and
publicity staffs, respectively. Third come publications of a technical
nature, like the official handbooks for scouts and officers and
outlines for training courses. These form part of the work of the
education department, which has general oversight of all that pertains
to training for leaders and the development of standards of
work, including the important feature of coordinating the girl
scouts with the other educational and social organizations. Camping
also forms a part of the work of the education department.</p>

<p>During 1919 and 1920 the following publications were issued:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang"><i>Scouting for Girls:</i> The official handbook, 576 pages.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Campward Ho:</i> A manual for girl-scout camps, 192 pages. Designed
to cover the needs of those undertaking to organize and
direct large, self-supporting camps for girls.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>The Blue Book of Rules for Girl Scout Captains:</i> All official rules
and regulations, 32 pages.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Training Courses:</i> (1) Outline for 32-period course, 17 pages. (2)
Introductory course, 10 periods, 16 pages.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Girl Scout Health Record:</i> Booklet form for recording points for
health winner's badge.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Miscellaneous Pamphlets:</i> Averaging 8 pages; 128,325 copies.</p></div>

<p><i>Need for leaders.</i>&mdash;The growth in membership has been twice as
rapid among the scouts as it has among the officers, as may be seen
in the table already given. For every scout in 1918 we have 10 in
1921. For every officer in 1918 we have but 5 in 1921. For some time
to come, therefore, the energy of the national officers must be directed
toward the securing of properly trained leaders.</p>

<p>Colleges and higher schools are responding to a gratifying extent
with the introduction of training courses in scouting for girls. Within
two years courses have been given at the following colleges or universities:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Adelphi, Boston, Bryn Mawr, Carnegie Institute, Cincinnati,
Converse, Elmira, Hunter, Johns Hopkins, Missouri, New
Rochelle, Northwestern, Pittsburg, Rochester Mechanics' Institute,
Rochester University, Rockford, Simmons, Smith, Syracuse, Teachers'
College, and Vassar. Also at the following higher schools: Battle
Creek Normal School of Physical Education, Brooklyn Training
School for Teachers, Chautauqua Institute, Chicago Normal School
of Physical Education, Community Service Council of Marquette
County, Mich., Manhattan Trade School for Girls, Milwaukee Normal,
State Normal at Pittsburgh, Pa., Washington State Normal, and
Western State Normal, Mich. The following schools and colleges are
asking for courses: Chicago, Cornell, Detroit Normal, Kalamazoo,
Michigan State Normal, Pennsylvania State, and Temple University.</p>

<p>Through cooperation with the deans of women in all parts of the
country, and with the Intercollegiate Community Service Association,
the college women are being influenced to take up scouting as an
extra academic activity before graduation, and as a form of community
service in their home towns later.</p>

<p>In addition to this work through existing educational bodies, many
special courses are conducted in connection with the organizations of
local councils.</p>

<p>The First National Training School for Girl Scout Officers has
been conducted for four years, the last two years at Long Pond Camp
in Plymouth, Mass. During the summer of 1920 special training
camps were also held in connection with the councils of Greater New
York, Cincinnati, and Harrisburg, with instruction given under the
auspices of national headquarters. Five such camps are planned for
1921, located in Plymouth, Central Valley, in the Catskills, Lake
Mohegan, N. Y., Philadelphia, and Cincinnati.</p>

<p><i>Scouting in the public schools.</i>&mdash;Only that organization for young
people can succeed which contributes directly to their chief business,
which is getting an education. One reason the girl scout organization
is received so cheerfully by school people is that it works into the
school's own plans to a remarkable degree. Local councils have a
larger representation from the public schools than from any other
single agency. Scout leaders are drawn largely from the teaching
force because teachers naturally have a better insight into the needs
of young people than any other single group.</p>

<p>In a few places this interest has resulted in the gradual assimilation
of scouting into the school system. At Fort Scott, Kans., this
work has progressed furthest, with 90 per cent of all pupils of scout
age, either boy or girl scouts. Supt. Ramsey made a most favorable
report on this situation at the Cleveland meeting of the Department
of Superintendence of the National Education Association in
1920. Among essential features he mentioned the following:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy scout executive and girl scout commissioner act as recreational
directors and have charge of all the health education and vocational
guidance.</p>

<p>A room is set aside in the Junior High School for all scout work
which, however, is passed upon by a council, including persons outside
of the school force.</p>

<p>Through glee clubs and choruses great interest in community singing
and other music has been developed. The scout organization is
helping to solve the dress problem for both boys and girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To give the modern ideals of education would be to state the
ideals of scouting.&rdquo; The modern teacher is increasingly well fitted
to become a good scout leader.</p>

<p>Scouting may best be promoted through the public school, because
that is the only organization that includes all the boys and
girls. Moreover, because of close daily association, leaders of school
troops can insure each scout being an active scout.</p>

<p>The school also benefits by scouting in a number of ways. Older
pupils stay in school longer because of their interest in scouting than
because of any other influence. &ldquo;A year of work in scouting will do
as much toward acquainting a teacher with the ideals of teaching as
a year spent in any college or university of the country.&rdquo; Finally,
scouting secures the interest, attention, and good will of the parents
to the public schools.</p>
